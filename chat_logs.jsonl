After removing the pattern, the cavity is filled with molten metal to produce the casting. The drag half of the pattern is placed on the mould board. A parting material (lycopodium talc) is dusted over the pattern and the moulding board\nto the removal of the pattern from the mould. The drag is filled with moulding sand and its is packed and rammed around the pattern. After the ramming, the excess sand is scrapped off with a straight bar called a\n\u201cStrike Rod\u201d. Vent holes are pierced in the sand with \"Vent Wires\" for the gases to escape through. The drag box mould is turned over 180\u00b0. The cope half of the pattern is properly positioned over the drag half of the pattern with the help of dowel pins and dowel holes. The cope flask is mounted onto the drag flask and the two halves are properly aligned\nwith the help of alignment pins. The sprue pin and riser pin are placed in the position. The operation of filling, ramming and venting of the cope proceed in the same manner\nas in the drag. A pouring basin is cut adjacent to the sprue and then the sprue and riser pins are withdrawn. The cope is carefully lifted off the temporarily separated from the drag and placed on one side. Split pattern from the drag and cope is lifted out. The gate and runner are cut in the drag  and cope, connecting the mould cavity and the\nsprue opening. The mould is now assembled, the cope being carefully placed over the drag so that\nthe locating pins fit into the holes. The mould is now ready for pouring. Sand moulding can produce complex shapes that machining cannot achieve. It is suitable for casting very small to very large components. Sand is cheap, easily available, and reusable, making the process economical. Both ferrous and non-ferrous metals can be cast. Design changes are easy by modifying the pattern or mould. Patterns and moulding boxes are cheaper compared to permanent mould dies. Sand moulds give rough surfaces, so machining is often needed. Shrinkage and mould deformation can cause errors in size. The process is slow due to mould preparation, pouring, cooling, and shakeout. Skilled workers are needed for pattern making, moulding, and finishing. Thin parts may not fill properly as the metal solidifies too quickly.
