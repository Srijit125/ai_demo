    "text": "To Identify and study major systems of a tractor and to learn general guidelines on preliminary check measures before starting a tractor - procedure for starting, running and stopping the tractor. Engine - Engine converts heat energy obtained during burning of fuel into mechanical energy. The energy obtained from engine is used to i) move the tractor ii) to pull the implements and trailer iii) to operate rotary machines like rotary tiller, pumping devices etc. Clutch - It is used to connect or disconnect engine power to the gear box of the tractor. Gear box - Gear box contains many pairs of gears to provide different speeds to the rear wheels. This system consists of components that are used to transmit the torque developed by the prime-mover or the engine to the driving wheels and to vary the torque and direction of rotation of the ground wheels. The greatest difference between transmission for farm tractors and those for highway vehicles is that in the tractor most of the gears may be used continuously under full load. Automobile transmissions would fail if they were run in low gear at full power for any length of time. All transmissions convert the engine torque and speed into a more useful combination of torque and speed at the drive wheels. Differential unit - This is also an assembly of gears in a special way. It provides differential speeds to rear wheels during turning of the tractor Final drive - This constitutes a pair of gears connecting the half shaft and the rear wheel axle so that the speed of the half shaft is very much reduced at the rear wheels and by this way the torque axle is increased. PTO shaft - Its full name is power take of shaft. It gets it drive from the gear box of the tractor. Rotating type of implements such as rotary tiller, water pumps, chaff cutter etc., can be operated using the PTO shaft drive. It is available at the rear /side of the tractor. The power available at the PTO shaft is about 87 % of engine power. Draw bar - It is a bracket located to the rear of the tractor to which trailed implements and trailers can be connected and worked. The power available at the draw bar is about 50-60 % of engine power. Because the maximum speed of a tractor is regulated by a governor, the potential maximum drawbar power of the tractor is nearly constant regardless of the forward speed, except for the lowest speeds when the maximum power is limited by traction. Hydraulic system - Hydraulic system operates the hydraulic cylinders which in turn actuate the lower links of the tractor so that the implements hitched to the lower links are lifted or lowered Three-point hitch system - The three links- one upper link and two lower links- available at the rear of the tractor constitute the three-point hitch system for the tractor. The lower links are actuated by the hydraulic system. An implement connected to the three links is called a mounted implement and an implement connected to the two lower links is called semi mounted implement. Steering system - It is useful to turn the front wheels either right side or left side so that tractor turns right or left. Brakes - when brakes are applied, brake drums located in the rear wheel drums stops the rotating wheels and the tractor stops. Cooling system - It cools the engine by removing heat with the help of water. It contains radiator, water pump, thermostat. Cool water is pumped into the water jackets of the engine, heat from engine body is transferred to water by conduction and the hot water is cooled in the radiator. Lubricating system - All the moving parts in the engine are lubricated by lubricating oil. Lubrication is necessary to reduce wear and tear of the moving parts of the engine. This system consists of oil sump, lubricating oil, and pipe lines.",

When it reads in the red band it means engine cooling in insufficient, may be due to defects in the cooling system components. This should be corrected. Oil gauge - It indicates the pressure with which oil is circulated in the engine parts. High pressure indicates blockage in the oil line and to be checked for correctness. Hour meter - It indicates the running hours of the engine Speedometer - It indicates the vehicle speed in km/h Ampere meter- It indicates the condition of the battery as well as charging of the battery by dynamo. All the above meters are placed in the panel board located in front of the driver.",
