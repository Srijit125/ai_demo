The field procedure is that the two stakes A and B accurately driven at the required  distance apart. The centers of the stakes are marked by driving wire nails. A cord is stretched between A and B. At A a perpendicular AD to AB is set out with a tape by 3,4,5, triangle method. A stake at D is driven measuring AD equal to the desired distance. Check the diagonal DB. Similarly, at B a perpendicular BC to AB is set out with a tape by 3,4,5 triangle  method. The stake C is also set by similar procedure. Check the distance CD which should be  equal to AB. The corners of the foundation plan are fixed by measuring the respected calculated  coordinates from the sides of the reference rectangle. The locations of the corner points are marked by driving pegs. A cord is passed round the periphery of the rectangles (1,2,3,4), (5,6,7,8),  (9,10,11,12) and (13,14,15,16) and the outline of the foundation is marked by  spreading lime along these lines.",

    "text": "For setting out the foundations of small buildings, the centre line of the longest  outer wall of the building is first marked on the ground by stretching a string  between wooden or mild steel pegs driven at the ends. This line serves as reference line. For accurate work, nails can be fixed at the  centre of the pegs. Two pegs, one on either side of the central peg, are driven at each end of the line.  Each peg is equidistant from the central peg, and the distance between the outer  pegs corresponds to the width of foundation trench to be excavated. Each peg may project about 25 to 50 mm above ground level and may be driven  at a distance of about 2 m from the edge of excavation so that they are not  disturbed. When string is stretched joining the corresponding pegs (say 2-2) at the two  extremities of the line, the boundary of the trench to be excavated can be marked  on the ground with dry lime powder. The centre lines of other walls, which are perpendicular to the long wall, are then  marked by setting out right angles. A right angle can be set out by forming a triangle with 3, 4 and 5 units long. These dimensions should be measured with the help of a steel tape.  Alternatively, a theodolite or prismatic compass may be used for setting out right  angles. Similarly, outer lines of the foundation trench of each cross-wall can be set out,  as shown in figure below. Fig 3: Setting out of foundation trench For a big project, reference pillars of masonry may be constructed. These pillars  may be about 20 cm thick, and about 15 cm wider than the width of the  foundation trench. The top of the pillars is plastered, and is set at the same level, preferably at the  plinth level. Pegs are embedded in these pillars and nails are then driven in the pegs to  represent the centre line and the outer lines of the trench. Sometimes, additional walls are provided to represent plinth lines. The following  figure shows the setting out using masonry pillars. Fig 4: Setting out using masonry pillars",

The test works in the principle of determining the degree of compaction achieved by a standard amount of work done by allowing the concrete to fall through a standard height. The degree of compaction called the compaction factor is measured by the density ratio i.e., the ratio of the density actually achieved in the test to density of same concrete fully compacted.
